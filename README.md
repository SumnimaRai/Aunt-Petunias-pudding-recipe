# Aunt-Petunias-pudding-recipe

*For our recipe, it's Chapter One from the book harry potter and the Chamber of Secrets - 'The Worst Birthday':*

    **On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding; a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets**

*It's finally time for Aunt Petunia's pudding to take flight as we recreate her famous floating dessert from the Chamber of Secrets!*

*Although the exact makeup of Aunt Petunia's pudding is open to interpretation, I've always seen it as a very colourful twist on the traditional pavlova, so for this week's recipe, I'll show you how to make the perfect melt in the mouth meringues before decorating with colourful creams, cherries and sugared violets.*

*Fans of the series will, of course, know that a few pages later a mischevious Dobby sends this glamourous pudding flying, so I've also got a little trick up my sleeve to create a levitating cloud effect underneath your pudding!*

*Pavlovas are incredibly easy to make, in fact the hardest part is deciding how you want to decorate them! Even if yours happens to end up on the floor (sorry Petunia!) I'm sure it will still taste great!*

*This recipe for Aunt Petunia's Pudding from the Chamber of Secrets is absolutely gorgeous and I'm sure your Harry Potter dinner party guests will be impressed - if they get the chance to try it before Dobby gets his hands on it!*
