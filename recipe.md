**Method:**

    *For the meringue, separate your egg whites being careful not to get any yolk in. Ensure that your mixing bowl is nice and clean and free from grease (Wizard tip! Wipe your bowl with lemon and a paper towel to remove any grease/residue)*

    *Whisk the egg whites on medium speed until it reaches soft peaks. Slowly add in the sugar a spoonful at a time waiting for it to be fully incorporated before you continue adding more.*

    *One the meringue is glossy, add in your salt, vanilla, cornflour and white wine vinegar and continue to whisk for around 5 minutes until it forms stiff peaks (Magic alert! Impress your guests by holding the bowl above your head... if you dare...)*

    *Use the bottom of a round tin to trace a circle onto your baking paper. You'll need one large 20cm circle and 3 smaller 16cm.*

    *Place the baking paper on to trays and transfer the meringue into a piping bag with a star nozzle. Pipe evenly around the circle stencil, filling in the middle. Bake the meringue disks in the oven at 100c for 1.5 hours. At this point, you'll want to turn off the oven, open the door slightly and then leave the meringues to cool inside.*

    *For the cream, stir the food colouring gel in so you have 600ml of green cream and 600ml purple. Whisk these with your vanilla and icing sugar until it forms stiff peaks - but be careful not to over whip! Transfer into piping bags and place in the fridge until ready to serve*

    *Clean your edible flowers, allow them to dry, but while slightly damp toss in the caster sugar and then place to the side to dry*

    *Take a clear cake board and break off pieces of candy floss, draping it around the sides to create a levitating smoke effect. Place the largest meringue disk on top.*

    *For the first layer alternate purple and green cream around the outside, placing cherries on top of the green swirls and sugared violets on the purple swirls. Then fill the centre with more cream.*

    *Sandwich your next meringue disk over the centre and alternate the cream as your stack the remaining layers. Large purple swirls with green in between, and then large green swirls with purple in between.*

    *For the top layer, you want to pipe continuous roses around the outside and then cherries in between*

    *And there you have it Aunt Petunia's Pudding ready to eat.*
